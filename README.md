In this code, I used different motion prediction algorithms such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Constant Velocity Model, Constant Acceleration Model, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Kalman Filter for predicting the motion of Autonomous Vehicles.
I have predicted the motion for two different time stamps: 13 frames and 125 frames.
